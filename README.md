# [UNITY] UI Config System

#### Description
This Library is intended to seperate data used in ingame userinterfaces from the objects it corresponds to. The ui data may be loaded dynamically to not consume memory when its not needed. By setting up configs to map ui data to a instance and storing those configs in collections the mapped data can be looked up by the configs reference.

**Known Issues**

**Change Log**
- early access

**Future Plans**
- search optimaziation for config collections
